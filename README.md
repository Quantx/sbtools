Mod Tools for Steel Battalion: Line of Contact

## Windows Usage
Ensure you have Python 3 installed, you can download the latest version from the [https://apps.microsoft.com/search?query=python3](Windows Store).

Your Line of Contact folder should contain "default.xbe" and "media". Drag and drop this folder onto "DRAG_ONTO_ME.bat" and sbtools should begin the conversion process after downloading FFMPEG and Godot.

When the conversion process is complete, a ".pck" file will be generated which can be imported by Godot. Additionally, the converted game assets will be available within the generated "build" directory.
